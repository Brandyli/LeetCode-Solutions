# 1) Connect table Person and Calls firstly under two conditional conditions
select c2.name as country

From Person p join Calls c1 on p.id=c1.callee_id or p.id=c1.caller_id

# 2) How can we connect callers and their countries? -- left(key,3) gets the first 3 numbers of the phone number
join Country c2 on c2.country_code = left(p.phone_number, 3)
group by c2.name

# 3) the countries where the average call duration of the calls 
# in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.
# avg(duration)> global average call duration = call duration that exist in table Calls
having avg(duration)>(select avg(duration) from Calls)

A:
select c1.name as Country
from Person p join Calls c2 
on p.id=c2.caller_id or p.id=c2.callee_id
join Country c1 
on c1.country_code=left(p.phone_number,3)
group by c1.name
having avg(duration)> (select avg(duration) from Calls);


Table Person:

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| id             | int     |

Each row of this table contains the caller id, callee id and the duration of the call in minutes. caller_id != callee_id
Q:

A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. 
The company intends to invest in the countries where the average call duration of the calls 
in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.
Write an SQL query to find the countries where this company can invest.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Person table:
+----+----------+--------------+
| id | name     | phone_number |
+----+----------+--------------+
| 3  | Jonathan | 051-1234567  |
| 12 | Elvis    | 051-7654321  |
| 1  | Moncef   | 212-1234567  |
| 2  | Maroua   | 212-6523651  |
| 7  | Meir     | 972-1234567  |
| 9  | Rachel   | 972-0011100  |
+----+----------+--------------+

Country table:

+----------+--------------+
| Peru     | 051          |
| Israel   | 972          |
| Morocco  | 212          |
| Germany  | 049          |
| Ethiopia | 251          |
+----------+--------------+

Calls table:
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| caller_id | callee_id | duration |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| 1         | 9         | 33       |
| 2         | 9         | 4        |
| 1         | 2         | 59       |
| 3         | 12        | 102      |
| 3         | 12        | 330      |
| 12        | 3         | 5        |

| 1         | 7         | 7        |
+-----------+-----------+----------+

Result table:
+----------+
| country  |
+----------+
| Peru     |
+----------+
The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000 
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 3 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where average call duration is greater than the global average, it's the only recommended country.
