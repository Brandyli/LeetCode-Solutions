key:# Group by on two columns of viewer_id and view_date to exclude duplicate rows in dataset

A:
select distinct viewer_id as id
from Views

# 1) all the people who viewed more than one article on the same date
group by view_date, viewer_id

# viewed more than one article
having count(distinct article_id)>1

# 2) sorted in ascending order by their id.
order by id;

Table: Views

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 
Q:
Write an SQL query to find all the people who viewed more than one article on the same date, sorted in ascending order by their id.

The query result format is in the following example:

Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 3          | 4         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Result table:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 5    |
| 6    |
+------+
