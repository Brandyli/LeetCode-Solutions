Key:union

UNION is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order

A:
# 1) to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16

select product_id, new_price as price from products 
where (product_id, change_date) in (select product_id, max(change_date) from products
where change_date <='2019-08-16'
group by product_id
)

# 2)the price of all products before any change is 10.

union
select distinct product_id, 10 from products 
group by product_id
having min(change_date) >'2019-08-16';


Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |

Q:
Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

The query result format is in the following example:

Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
