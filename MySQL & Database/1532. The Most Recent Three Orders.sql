Logic:

# 1) Sketch the structure
# +---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
# | customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
# +---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
select c.name as customer_name, c.customer_id, o1.order_id,o1.order_date
from Customers c join Orders o1
on c.customer_id=o1.customer_id

# 2) find the most recent 3 orders of each user
where (select count(*) from Orders o2
      where o1.customer_id=o2.customer_id
      # ----Since it potentially counts the first order_date for the base comparison
      # the rest recent orders needed to be found
      and o1.order_date<o2.order_date)<=2) 
      
# 3) sorted by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order.If there still a tie, order them by the order_date in descending order.
order by customer_name asc, customer_id asc,order_date desc;

A:


Table: Customers

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about customers.
 

Table: Orders

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| cost          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
Each customer has one order per day.
 
Q:
Write an SQL query to find the most recent 3 orders of each user. If a user ordered less than 3 orders return all of their orders.

Return the result table sorted by customer_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the customer_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by the order_date in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Customers
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+

Orders
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 30   |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 40   |
| 3        | 2020-07-31 | 3           | 70   |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 100  |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 1010 |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 102  |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 111  |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 99   |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 32   |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+

Result table:
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| Annabelle     | 3           | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| Annabelle     | 3           | 3        | 2020-07-31 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 9        | 2020-08-07 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 2        | 2020-07-30 |
| Marwan        | 4           | 4        | 2020-07-29 |
| Winston       | 1           | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| Winston       | 1           | 1        | 2020-07-31 |
| Winston       | 1           | 10       | 2020-07-15 |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
Winston has 4 orders, we discard the order of "2020-06-10" because it is the oldest order.
Annabelle has only 2 orders, we return them.
Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.
