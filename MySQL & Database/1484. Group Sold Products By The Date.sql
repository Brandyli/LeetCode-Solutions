Key:
GROUP_CONCAT:  将 group by 产生的同一个分组中的值连接起来，返回一个字符串结果。

GROUP_CONCAT(
    DISTINCT expression
    ORDER BY expression
    SEPARATOR sep
);

group_concat( [distinct] 要连接的字段 [order by 排序字段 asc/desc ] [separator '分隔符'] )

说明：通过使用distinct可以排除重复值；如果希望对结果中的值进行排序，可以使用order by子句；separator是一个字符串值，缺省为一个逗号。

Logics:
# 1) find for each date, the number of distinct products sold and their names
select sell_date, count(distinct product) as num_sold, group_concat(distinct product) as products  
from Activities

# 2) sold-products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically
group by sell_date
order by sell_date

A:
select sell_date, count(distinct product) as num_sold, group_concat(distinct product) as products  
from Activities
group by sell_date
order by sell_date

Table Activities:

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contains duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
 

Write an SQL query to find for each date, the number of distinct products sold and their names.

The sold-products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically. 

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

Activities table:
+------------+-------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |
+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by comma.
For 2020-06-02, Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.
