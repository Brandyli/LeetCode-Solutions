Key: sum(if (condition1, result1,result2))

Logic:
# Q: report the difference between number of apples and oranges sold each day

1) # report the difference between number of apples and oranges
# +------------+--------------+
# | sale_date  | diff         |
# +------------+--------------+
select sale_date, sum(if(fruit='apples', sold_num,-sold_num)) as diff
from Sales

2) sold each day
group by sale_date

# order by sale_date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD')
# no need for order by since the original order satisfies the order request

A:
select sale_date, sum(if(fruit='apples', sold_num,-sold_num)) as diff 
from Sales
group by sale_date

Q:
Write an SQL query to report the difference between number of apples and oranges sold each day.

Return the result table ordered by sale_date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+

Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).
