Key: Not all tables listed need to be used if it is useless for the result query

A:

select project_id
from project p 
group by project_id
having count(employee_id)
order by count(employee_id) desc
limit 1;


Table: Project

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
Table: Employee

+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table.
 

Q:
Write an SQL query that reports all the projects that have the most employees.

The query result format is in the following example:

Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| project_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The first project has 3 employees while the second one has 2.
