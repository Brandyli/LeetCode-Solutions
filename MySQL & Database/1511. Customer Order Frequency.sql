Logic:

# report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who have spent at least $100 in each month of June and July 2020.
# 1) report the customer_id and customer_name of customers
select  customer_id, name 
from Customers  join Orders  using (customer_id)
join Product  using(product_id)
group by customer_id

# 2) who have spent at least $100 in each month of June and July 2020.
# using if() to filter out the orders out of requested June and July
having sum(if(left(order_date,7)='2020-06',quantity,0)*price) >=100 
and sum(if(left(order_date, 7)='2020-07',quantity,0)*price)>=100;

select customer_id, name
from Customers join Orders using (customer_id)
join Product using (product_id)
group by customer_id
having sum(if(left(order_date,7)='2020-06',quantity,0)*price)>=100
